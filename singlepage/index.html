Automation System contains the details about bus schedules and its fare tariffs,
 passenger reservations and ticket records. A bus inventory contains all bus with their available seats. The inventory of an automation booking service is having seats up to 26 bookings, along with prices and booking conditions. Inventory data is imported and maintained through a Schedule Distribution System over standardized interfaces.
 One of the core functions of the inventory management of bus reservations is the inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available for the different booking classes, by opening and closing individual booking classes for sale.
 In combination with the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System the price for each sold seat is determined.</p>
